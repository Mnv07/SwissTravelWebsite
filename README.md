# SwissTravelWebsite
A website I am creating for learning CSS .   https://mnv07.github.io/SwissTravelWebsite/ is the link. Check it out!

The webpage has different CSS effects that enable smooth scrolling and give it a really nice aesthetic look. I plan on expanding this once I'm very proficient with javascript and react!!
